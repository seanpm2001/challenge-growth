# Challenge 1: Twitter Thread

Write an educational Twitter threads on something to do with bash / zsh / CLIs / terminals. Also submit 5 other ideas that you brainstormed that would make great threads.

With every educational Twitter thread we do, our aim is get as many likes as possible. Why? Likes convert to followers who will continue to read other content we create, including content about Fig specifically, which will lead to more users. 

Our Twitter audience is comprised of very intellectually curious people. They are constantly learning and trying to improve themselves. 

We think the thread should be at least 4 Tweets. This doesn't mean you need to have more than 4 tweets - if you can convey everything you need to know in just 4 tweets, that's great!

**Some examples of things that you could write about**
* Bash syntax:
  * Process substitution
  * Command substitution
  * Subshells
  * brace expansion
  * variable expansion
* CLI tools
  * Popular unix CLI tools and what they do (e.g. "what is `sed`", "what is `awk`")
  * Popular modern CLI tools (e.g. `bat` vs `cat`)
  * Unknown but useful subcommands/options/flags in popular CLI tools (e.g. here is a subcommand in `git` that you probably didn't know about)
  * CLI tool history e.g. why are CLI tools slightly different on each operating system (e.g. bsd vs macOS)

**Our suggestions**
* Use screenshots of code blocks (check out [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) or [ray.so](https://ray.so) and/or screenshots of your terminal (use a nice background and make sure text is readable)
* Keep tweets short and bite sized. No one wants to read a wall of text!
* The most interesting tweets have very useful and practical examples that the reader could add to their workflow instantly
